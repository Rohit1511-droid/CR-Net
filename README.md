# CR-Net
Developed a CNN based model using Pytorch that classifies the input CT scan images as Covid infected
or as healthy ( not infected ).
Input images are filtered using a GRU Layer for better accuracy.
The accuracy obtained from the proposed CR Net model is 79% which is slightly lesser than that of
some of the pre - trained standard models.
The prediction time of proposed model is lesser than that of pre - trained standard models.
The model is lighter and is suitable to use on the web.
